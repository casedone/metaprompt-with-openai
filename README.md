'metaprompt' is a huge prompt made by Anthropic for the purpose of helping humans write effective prompts. Deep-dive in understanding 'metaprompt' can be found in my blog post ["metaprompt" is a "prompt generator"](https://casedonebyai.substack.com/p/metaprompt-is-a-prompt-generator?utm_source=github&utm_medium=github-readme).
